# Firebase ML Kit
Google i/o 2018
Contains prebuilt API's which provide ML functionalities for Android and iOS apps
Support for running custom models

Available API's
  ->Text recognition
  ->Face detection
  ->Barcode scanning
  ->Image labelling
  ->Landmark recognition
  ->Hosting custom Tensorflow models

1. Creating a good dataset (Minimum 150 images of each class, Noise should be there in training data, augment dataset by rotation, scaling and cropping)
2. Training the model (Transfer Learning, convert trained model to a tensorflow lite build-> for mobiles)
3. Upload model to Firebase
4. Set up the model with firebase
5. Run the model over the image(specify input and output)
6. Extract data from the result
